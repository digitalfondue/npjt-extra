TODO
====

- Expose the type mapping infrastructure for the custom mappers (if they implement a specific subtype of RowMapper)
	- a refactor on this part will be necessary

- @AutoGeneratedKey has some shortcoming:
	- no automatic type conversion with the current infrastructure of ColumnMapper
	- single field name for all DB

- Support stored procedures in the annotation(?)
